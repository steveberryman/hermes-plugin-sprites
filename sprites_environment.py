"""Sprites execution environment (standalone Hermes plugin).

Originally authored by Kyle McLaren (@kylemclaren, Fly.io) as hermes-agent
PR #30112, hardened in salvage PR #93523. Extracted to this standalone
plugin repo when terminal backends became pluggable (hermes-agent PR #94400).

Uses the sprites-py SDK (https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py) to run
commands in Sprites — stateful cloud sandboxes on Fly.io, with
checkpoint & restore. Persistent by default: each Sprite outlives the session
and is reused via a deterministic, profile-scoped name — ``hermes-{task_id}``
on the default profile, ``hermes-{display}-{digest}`` on named profiles (see
``_resolve_sprite_name`` for the full contract). Cleanup leaves the Sprite
running when ``persistent_filesystem`` is True; the Sprite is deleted otherwise.
